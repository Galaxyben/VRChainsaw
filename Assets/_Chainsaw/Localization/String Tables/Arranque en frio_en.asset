      the ground; otherwise, starting it could damage the blade and unnecessarily
      jeopardize your safety.

  - m_Id: 1104745947143
    m_Localized: We have performed the operation known as COLD START, which is used
      to start the chainsaw at the beginning of the day. If you wish to restart it
      later the same day, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE THE CHOKE IN THE ON POSITION.
      Start the chainsaw with the same process but with the CHOKE IN THE OFF POSITION.
