    m_Localized: A chainsaw is an electric or gasoline-powered tool used for cutting
      wood. It consists of a  chain with sharp teeth that rotates around a bar, allowing
      for quick and efficient cuts in  logs and branches. It is commonly used in
      tree felling, pruning, and construction.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 2
    m_Localized: Chainsaws typically weigh between 6 and 22 lbs (3 to 10 kg) and
      have bars ranging  from 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) in length. Their general
      dimensions are  approximately 12-16 inches (30-40 cm) wide and 10-12 inches
      (25-30 cm) high,  although this may vary by model.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3
    m_Localized: Now let's look at the fundamental parts of the chainsaw.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4
    m_Localized: Safety trigger
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5
    m_Localized: It is a safety element of the chainsaw, making it one of the most
      important for its  operation. In fact, if it is not pressed, the throttle trigger
      cannot be activated,  which prevents accidents.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6
    m_Localized: Front guard
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 7
    m_Localized: 'This part serves two functions: on the one hand, it protects the
      hand holding the  tool by the front handle, and at the same time, it acts as
      a chain brake that reduces  the likelihood of injury from the machine''s kickback
      when stopping.'

  - m_Id: 8
    m_Localized: Start
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 9
    m_Localized: The start mechanism is one of the parts of a chainsaw that you will
      handle the  most, so you should treat it carefully to avoid breakdowns and
      extend its  durability. It is the pull cord that you use to start the tool
      each time you use it by  pulling it repeatedly.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 10
    m_Localized: Front handle
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11
    m_Localized: The front handle is the part of the chainsaw that is closest to
      the blade. This  means it is the most likely to pose risks; the design of chainsaws
      ensures that this  grip is intended for the left hand, which is used to guide
      the orientation of the  tool.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 12
    m_Localized: Rear handle
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 13
    m_Localized: Your right hand, on the other hand, will hold the rear handle of
      the machine and  will be responsible for supporting its weight and providing
      stability. On it are the  safety and throttle triggers, which must be pressed
      at all times for the chainsaw to  function.

    m_Localized: Fuel tank
    m_Metadata:

  - m_Id: 15
    m_Localized: Another part of the chainsaw that requires the most care is the
      fuel tank. It is  essential to consult the manufacturer's instructions to check
      and always adhere to  the recommended proportions in the gasoline and oil mixture.

    m_Localized: Although it is the most obvious explanation among all the parts
      that make up the  chainsaw, it is worth emphasizing its importance and the
      need to maintain proper  levels. Proper lubrication is essential for the operation
      and safety of the chainsaw.

  - m_Id: 19
    m_Localized: It is powered by a centrifugal clutch and a sprocket, which initiate
      the start to  allow the chainsaw to operate through internal combustion. Generally,
      the  cylinder volume ranges between 30 and 120 cubic centimeters, depending
      on the  manufacturer.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: Bumper guard
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 21
    m_Localized: In addition to the aforementioned front guard, at the base of the
      blade, there are  generally projections designed for protection to prevent
      injuries from the  chainsaw's kickback when it stops.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 22
    m_Localized: Throttle
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 23
    m_Localized: The throttle, or throttle trigger, is located inside the upper part
      of the rear handle.  It is designed so you can operate it while supporting
      the tool's weight. Remember,  it will not function if you are not simultaneously
      pressing the safety trigger.

      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Chain
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 25
    m_Localized: Among the parts of the chainsaw, the cutting chain is the most related
      to cutting. It  rotates around the guide bar and is made up of small, extremely
      sharp metal teeth.  It can be very dangerous if not handled under safe conditions,
      with the tool  completely turned off.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 26
    m_Localized: Guide bar
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 27
    m_Localized: The guide bar is the part of the chainsaw that gives it its distinctive
      shape. It  serves to guide the cutting chain and is elongated to facilitate
      cutting tasks such  as pruning, allowing you to reach more distant branches
      due to its length.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 28
    m_Localized: Bumper spikes
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 29
    m_Localized: The bumper spike or "bark spike" is a component that guides the
      guide bar's cut.  It embeds itself into the bark of large-diameter trees, providing
      safety and acting  as a pivot between the engine and the guide bar.
    m_Metadata:

  - m_Id: 30
    m_Localized: Primer or purge bulb
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 31
    m_Localized: The primer or purge button on a chainsaw moves fuel from the tank
      and  carburetor using suction. This suction provides enough gas in the carburetor
      and  cylinder to start the engine.

    m_Localized: "Its main function is to provide a richer mixture of air and fuel
      to the engine  when it is cold, helping to ensure a smooth and trouble-free
      start.  Sa fonction principale est de fournir un m\xE9lange plus riche d'air
      et de carburant  au moteur lorsqu'il est froid, ce qui aide \xE0 assurer un
