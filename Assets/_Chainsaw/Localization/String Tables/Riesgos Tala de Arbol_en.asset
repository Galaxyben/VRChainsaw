      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38872637442
    m_Localized: ATTENTION!. Hold the chainsaw with the left handle of the front
      grip (to do this, press the trigger and left handle grip and keep them pressed
      to hold the grip). IT IS ESSENTIAL TO PASS THE LEFT HAND THUMB UNDER THE GRIP
      TO COMPLETELY CLOSE THE LEFT HAND AROUND THE FRONT GRIP.

    m_Localized: ATTENTION!. With the right handle, hold the rear grip (to do this,
      press the right handle grip and hold it, the right handle trigger will be used
      as the chainsaw accelerator).

    m_Localized: Planning when carrying out logging is vital; we must consider those
      factors and elements that may pose a risk to safely and controlledly felling
      trees.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38872637449
    m_Localized: We must observe the proximity of power lines in the area where we
      want to fell the tree. There should be an adequate distance between the tree
      felling and the power lines. Check your country's regulations for more details
      on safety distances.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38872637450
    m_Localized: Additionally, we will consider other elements where the felled tree
      may fall, such as roads and buildings. If these elements are within the felling
      area, special measures will need to be taken.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38872637451
    m_Localized: "Under normal circumstances, it is strongly discouraged to carry
      out tree felling in adverse weather conditions, such as heavy snowfalls, rain,
      or thunderstorms with electrical components, as well as dense fog. Special
      consideration should be given to the wind\u2014tree felling should not be performed
      with winds exceeding 40 kilometers per hour."

    m_Localized: To create a safety perimeter around the tree to be felled, we first
      need to determine its height. There are several methods to measure it, ranging
      from simple to complex. Here is a very easy and straightforward method that
      will allow you to estimate the height of the tree.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831744
    m_Localized: Hold a stick with your arm extended straight in front of you so
      that the length of the stick is equal to the distance between your eye and
      your hand. Then, place the stick in a vertical position so that a right triangle
      is formed between your eye, hand, and the top of the stick.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831745
    m_Localized: Aim at the tree and stand at a distance where the tree appears as
      tall as the length of the stick. If the tree is leaning, you will get more
      accurate results if you take the measurement from the side so that the tree
      is not leaning towards you or away from you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831746
    m_Localized: The distance between where you are and the tree will be equal to
      its height. Count the steps or measure with a tape measure. Always add a wide
      margin of error.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831747
    m_Localized: Once we know the height of the tree, we will create a safety perimeter.
      This safety perimeter should have a radius from the tree of at least twice
      its height.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831748
    m_Localized: Point with the pointer at the designated trees to create the safety
      perimeter with marking tape. Hold down the trigger button between one tree
      and another to create the perimeter with the marking tape.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831749
    m_Localized: We will ensure that the tree is in good condition and does not show
      signs of decay at its base, as this could cause the tree to collapse on us
      once we start felling it, not falling to one side but onto itself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831750
    m_Localized: We will also take into account the condition of the branches, paying
      special attention to any broken branches that could fall during the felling
      process.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831751
    m_Localized: Every tree has a natural falling direction, which may be influenced
      by its inclination, the shape and location of its branches, accumulation of
      snow, etc.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831752
    m_Localized: Whenever possible, we should fell the tree so that it falls in its
      natural falling direction. If this is not feasible, we must use special techniques
      to make the tree fall in a direction different from its natural inclination.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38876831753
    m_Localized: Create an escape zone by removing nearby bushes and obstacles using
      the controller pointer at an angle of about 45 degrees on both sides behind
      the tree to be felled. Point the pointer at the bush you want to remove and
      press the trigger button to eliminate it.
