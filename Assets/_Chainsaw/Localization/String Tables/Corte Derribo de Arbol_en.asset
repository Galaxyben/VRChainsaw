    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20992319490
    m_Localized: ATTENTION!. Hold the chainsaw with the left handle of the front
      grip (to do this, press the trigger and left handle grip and keep them pressed
      to hold the grip). IT IS ESSENTIAL TO PASS THE LEFT HAND THUMB UNDER THE GRIP
      TO COMPLETELY CLOSE THE LEFT HAND AROUND THE FRONT GRIP.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20992319491
    m_Localized: ATTENTION!. With the right handle, hold the rear grip (to do this,
      press the right handle grip and hold it, the right handle trigger will be used
      as the chainsaw accelerator).

    m_Localized: PROHIBITED TO MAKE CUTS WITH PEOPLE AROUND AT LEAST 2 METERS IN
      A CIRCLE FROM THE CUTTING AREA.

    m_Localized: PROHIBITED TO CUT WITH A CHAINSAW AT A HEIGHT ABOVE OUR SHOULDERS.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20992319495
    m_Localized: 'ATTENTION!: DO NOT MAKE SAWING MOVEMENTS. IF THE MACHINE STOPS
      MID-CUT, REMOVE THE STOPPED CHAINSAW AND TRY AGAIN. DO NOT START IT IN THE
      MIDDLE OF THE CUT.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20992319496
    m_Localized: 'When we want to fell a tree, we must make two basic cuts: the directional
      cut and the felling cut. Between them, we must leave an intact strip of wood
      called the hinge.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20992319497
    m_Localized: The most common directional cut is the angled opening cut. It is
      the most recommended because it can be used in most cases.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20992319498
    m_Localized: 'The directional cut has two stages: an upper angled cut and a lower
      straight cut.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20992319499
    m_Localized: Position yourself supported on your knee and make the first cut
      in the marked area using the lower part of the blade at a 45-degree attack
      angle. The cut should be between 15 and 20% of the trunk's diameter.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513792
    m_Localized: Now, while keeping your knee on the ground, we will make the lower
      cut using the bottom part of the blade in a straight manner. The cut is completed
      when it meets the angled cut, forming a wooden wedge.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513793
    m_Localized: For the directional cut to be correct, it must be made as close
      as possible to the base of the tree to provide stability and control in the
      felling process.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513794
    m_Localized: The felling cut is made once the directional cut has been completed,
      and it is performed exactly on the opposite side of where the directional cut
      was made.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513795
    m_Localized: Now, position yourself on the opposite side and, while keeping your
      knee on the ground, we will make the cut using the lower part of the blade
      in a straight manner in the marked area. This cut is performed at the same
      level or slightly above the directional cut.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513796
    m_Localized: It is very important to stop the felling cut before reaching the
      directional cut to form what is known as a hinge.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513797
    m_Localized: The hinge is a key element in ensuring a safe and clean tree felling.
      The intact wood between the two cuts serves as support and guides the tree
      as it falls.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513798
    m_Localized: "The hinge must have a uniform length and thickness. Its length
      should be at least 80%, and its thickness at least 10% of the tree\u2019s diameter."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513799
    m_Localized: The angle of the directional cut will determine how long the hinge
      remains intact. Angles below 45 degrees will accelerate the tree felling process.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 20996513800
    m_Localized: Once both cuts have been made, the tree will fall in the direction
      where the directional cut was made.
