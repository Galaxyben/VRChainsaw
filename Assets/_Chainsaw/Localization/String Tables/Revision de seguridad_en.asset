    m_Localized: Now we are going to carry out the safe work protocol with the chainsaw,
      go to the green circle in front of the table where the protective equipment
      is located.

    m_Localized: The forestry helmet is an essential piece of protective equipment
      for working in forest environments. It typically includes a durable helmet
      that protects the head from impacts, a visor or metal screen to protect the
      face from splinters and debris, and earmuffs that reduce the noise from tools
      like chainsaws.

    m_Localized: Chainsaw protective boots are an essential piece of equipment for
      those who work in forest environments or perform gardening and logging tasks.
      These boots are designed to provide high resistance to cuts, thanks to their
      special material that can stop the chainsaw chain in case of an accident. Additionally,
      they are usually waterproof and have non-slip soles for added safety.

  - m_Id: 7304535307280384
    m_Localized: Chainsaw cut-resistant clothing is designed to protect the user
      from accidental cuts. It is made with special materials, such as resistant
      fibers, that stop the chain upon contact, preventing serious injuries. It is
      essential for forestry or gardening tasks involving the use of chainsaws.

    m_Localized: You already have your protective equipment on, now move to the green
      circle where the chainsaw and other tools are located to start its setup before
      starting it.

    m_Localized: Take the fuel can and pour it into the tank to fill the chainsaw
      with fuel.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 7304535307280387
    m_Localized: The ideal mixture for a chainsaw is usually unleaded gasoline and
      two-stroke oil in a 50:1 ratio (50 parts gasoline to 1 part oil). It is crucial
      to use oil specifically designed for two-stroke engines and mix well before
      filling the tank. This ensures optimal performance and protects the engine.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 7304535307280388
    m_Localized: Fuel has spilled on the table and over the chainsaw. We need to
      be careful as it could cause fires once the chainsaw is running due to the
      heat of the engine.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 7304535307280389
    m_Localized: Take the cloth and clean up the fuel spill from the table and the
      chainsaw.

    m_Localized: Take the chainsaw and open the lubricant tank.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 7304535307280391
    m_Localized: Chain lubrication is important when using a chainsaw to prevent
      it from overheating during cutting and to ensure it rotates around the guide
      bar without friction. This extends the lifespan of the guide bar and chain.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 7304535307280392
    m_Localized: All set. The lubricant oil tank has been filled.

    m_Localized: Now let's check the chainsaw chain tension. Hold the chainsaw with
      one hand and with the other, grab the bottom of the chain and pull it downward.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 7304535311474688
    m_Localized: The chain stretches with use. A chain without enough tension can
      come loose and cause serious, even fatal, accidents. Therefore, it is important
      to adjust it frequently to compensate for this change. The chain tension should
      be checked every time the fuel is refilled. New chains require a break-in period
      during which tension should be monitored more frequently.

    m_Localized: With the combination wrench, loosen the nuts on the guide bar that
      hold the clutch cover. Tighten the chain with the tip of the guide bar pointing
      upward. To do this, use the combination wrench to tighten the tensioning screw
      by turning it to the right. Tighten the chain until it no longer hangs from
      the bottom of the guide bar. Check that the chain can be easily rotated by
      hand and does not hang underneath the guide bar. Use the combination wrench
      to retighten the nuts on the guide bar.

    m_Localized: We have completed the basic check before starting to work with the
      chainsaw. In addition to this check, you should perform regular maintenance,
      including filter cleaning, chain sharpening, and spark plug inspection.
